            <p class="section-text">Emotional care is a crucial aspect of our outreach efforts. It involves creating a supportive environment that acknowledges and addresses the emotional well-being of individuals facing challenging circumstances. My approach focuses on offering empathy, understanding, and a comforting presence to those navigating difficult situations. Through tailored emotional care initiatives, I strive to uplift spirits, provide solace, and foster a sense of resilience among the individuals and families I serve. My goal is to contribute not only to their physical well-being but also to their emotional and mental health, recognizing the interconnected nature of overall wellness.</p>

            <p class="section-text">I have worked to return households to financial self-sufficiency through enrollment in the formal banking system, basic income and small business grants, and support for additional skills or small business training. I also serve families living in extreme poverty who also suffer from diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cervical cancer, and tuberculosis. I want to see individuals and families restored to health and able to meet their economic needs without outside help.</p>
