                <p class="emotional-care__text">Emotional care is a crucial aspect of our outreach efforts. It involves creating a
                    supportive environment that acknowledges and addresses the emotional well-being of individuals facing
                    challenging circumstances. My approach focuses on offering empathy, understanding, and a comforting
                    presence to those navigating difficult situations. Through tailored emotional care initiatives, I strive
                    to uplift spirits, provide solace, and foster a sense of resilience among the individuals and families
                    I serve. My goal is to contribute not only to their physical well-being but also to their emotional and
                    mental health, recognizing the interconnected nature of overall wellness.</p>

                    or small business training. I also serve families living in extreme poverty who also suffer from
                    diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cervical cancer, and tuberculosis. I want to see individuals and families
                    restored to health and able to meet their economic needs without outside help.</p>
